Millions of people share their photos with the world every day! Selfies, nature pics and anything else from your day-to-day life are common Instagram content. So why couldn’t it be a perfect chance for a promotion campaign in Instagram?

= Non-Square Photos in Instagram Plugin =

Several months ago Instagram published a new update which allows uploading photos with any dimensions to your Instagram profile. A lot of Instagram users were waiting for this option for a very long time. No matter what is the primary size of your Instagram image, now you can publish non-square photos. This feature opens up new opportunities for bloggers, photographers and may others who keep Instagram accounts. On the other hand, web audience will see chaos in any Instagram grid where images with different size proportions are displayed.

Owing to non-square Instagram images, the new issue appeared. More freedom for posting means more chaos in your Instagram feed. The issue refers to the outlay of photos in a grid presented in Instagram plugin InstaLink Lite. For now photos have different dimensions and they are displayed in different proportions that's why the Instagram feed can look terrible on a website.

We’ve noticed that a lot of users of Instagram plugins faced this issue on their websites. A pleasant look has a great importance for any product. Understanding it, we’ve included non-square Instagram photos support to our Instagram plugin. The new feature will automatically adjust any Instagram images to the square layout. That’s why all photos will be shown in the form of a beautiful Instagram grid. Thereby, we’ve returned an old tradition of standard Instagram shape.
